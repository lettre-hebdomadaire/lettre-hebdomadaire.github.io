                <h1>Interview of NainAs</h1>
                <h2></h2>
                <p style="font-size: smaller;">
                    <i>  le August 28, 2023</i></p>
                <p>For its big comeback, LH got in early (as always, of course), and interviewed, just for you, nainA and even 2A, some of those eligible for our beloved school. No idea where they are now, however (nahh it’s not true I did run into Arnaud at the pre-wei binouze, gg Arnaud we love you). Anyway, here are our two victims:</p>
                <p><strong>LH:</strong> What’s your name? Which school do you come from?<br>
                -Arnaud, I’m from Blaise Pascal in Orsay, choice MP (Math-Physics)<br>
                -Abdellah, same as him, choice MP.</p>
                <p><em>By saying this, they were target by Xavier C. Apparently, they didn’t plan for any khuber’s presence (Hang in there youngsters!)</em></p>
                <p><strong>LH:</strong> Which school are you planning to go to (*wink*)?<br>
                <strong>Arnaud:</strong> Télécom has a better atmosphere, even if the crêpes at Centrale are good. At Centrale, we’re all actors. And my brother is at Télécom.<br>
                <strong>Abdellah:</strong> No idea, let’s say Télécom.</p>
                <p>Well, that’s not too bad. We count on TéléBreizh to make us look good on crêpes.</p>
                <p><strong>LH</strong>: Well, pass on to the important questions: what’s your favorite manga? You should know that you’re in a weebs hideout here.<br>
                <strong>Ar:</strong> Uh, the only manga I’ve ever read is Dragon Ball Z, so let’s go with that.<br>
                <strong>Ab:</strong> Same thing, Dragon Ball.<br>
                <strong>Ar:</strong> I watch a lot of anime, though!</p>
                <p><strong>LH:</strong> So you’re planning to do LV3 Japanese?<br>
                <strong>Ar:</strong> No, I’ll take whatever’s useful.</p>
                <p>(ouch.)</p>
                <p><strong>LH:</strong> And Abdellah, do you know what you’re going to take as LV3?<br>
                <strong>Ab:</strong> German’s dead, not my choice.</p>
                <p>Ahh, the trauma of students who chose German in high school. I always have the impression that whoever the teacher is, that’s how it ends.</p>
                <p><strong>LH</strong>: Well, what about Telecom associations (because that’s the most important thing here), are any of them of interest to you?<br>
                <strong>Ar:</strong> BDS, Comète, TSM, it’s all very in fashion. I haven’t heard much about the BDE.<br>
                <strong>Ab:</strong> I don’t follow anything, I only know about kebabs.<br>
                <strong>LH:</strong> You’re right, that’s the main thing. But do you know about LH at least?<br>
                <strong>Ar:</strong> We got the brochure, and then this leaflet (He shows us the fantastic leaflet published by the LH to get eligible people to come and see us).</p>
                <p>Associations are important to the LH. So we want to make people know about them. In short, we focus on (tunnel) them in our club, because we love our associations. They get focused on (tunnelled) by Vincent, because Vincent likes to tunnel people. And at the end of this double tunnel, we’re talking about Téléchess, so of course we’re talking about our Ppom who is known nationally:</p>
                <p><strong>LH:</strong> Are you planning to do away with Ppom?<br>
                <strong>Both:</strong> ???</p>
                <p><strong>LH:</strong> Let’s take that as a yes. But let’s get down to business. LH is real journalism, so now we’re going to ask you some more serious questions. First: If you were ever cursed by a witch and turned into soup, what kind of soup would you be?<br>
                <strong>Ar:</strong> (Without any hesitation) A goulash but without beef, because it’s cursed so it sucks. If I’m blessed, it’s a good goulash.<br>
                <strong>Ab:</strong> Gazpacho but without salt, with chilli, without tomato.</p>
                <p>We wonder about the definition of gazpacho. After at least 5 seconds of thoughtful silence, we continue:</p>
                <p><strong>LH:</strong> Imagine, you’ve got a school with the X scholarship, but it’s in Perpignan. Do you go there?<br>
                <strong>Ar:</strong> Where is Perpignan? From the name alone, no.</p>
                <p>Hard blow for Perpignanais(?) in Télécom.</p>
                <p><strong>LH:</strong> Hint: the mayor is from the RN (Rassemblement National).<br>
                Arnaud taps Abdellah on the shoulder</p>
                <p>With those kind words, we start tunneling them again, this time on the LH. We make them read a little. And the truth comes out from the mouths of our dear and impartial eligible student:</p>
                <p><strong>Ar:</strong> It’s Baudelaire who turns lead into gold.</p>
