                <p>After months of work and packing stuff within trucks like they were Tetris blocks, here is the beginning of the year.</p>
                <p>The integration afternoon flies by, granitas tanks filled to the brim were getting emptied in minutes and the first groups were already taking shape. Finally, after a formidable pre-WEI, it was time to leave for this already mythical Weekend.</p>
                <p>Right at the start, the tone was already set: 3 people missed their train, and two others joined them thanks to the TER. For its passengers this all seemed to be like a movie scene, but we had to carry on. People were speaking up and were starting to come together.</p>
                <p>When we arrived at the camping, some were disappointed by the shared toilets whereas others were happy to finally put down their bags. One thing was for certain: the toast organized by the forum is a sight to behold. It’s only the first evening and yet everything is being done to tighten the bonds between people: stolen doors let people see each other, vanishing beds made so that people had to share and holes in the roof paved the way for new discoveries. This year, the first-year students were very eager to make their costumes stand out: Pyramids, a crocodile and even the Nile (yes, the river) and they sure succeeded. Even three camping strangers joined in on the fun, that’s how enjoyable this WEI was. The evening goes by and the first Telecom Paris traditions start showing up, a few shy “Ma Bite” (My Dick) and at the end of the night a suicidal first year assaulted the bar and was thus sacrificed.</p>
                <p>The next day, people got up at 10 to see the presentation of the different associations. Most come on foot, except for the first year brought back by the baker. There we saw a lot of half-conscious gazes, unreliable translations, an emetophobic warning and smile-bringing bomber jackets but it finally ended.  The afternoon went without issues except for a few twisted ankles and some broken toes. But a question lingers: what were the results? The feast wouldn’t bring any answer, especially since the costumes bring new questions: who is hiding behind tekpaf, Barbie or even the Qataris?</p>
                <p>Then came the third day. Those here for breakfast were now seen as survivors. The morning was calm, despite the sick beats of la Scène followed by games organized by the JE, the karaoke being replaced by the cries of the braves souls doing bungee jumping. The evening was way more energetic with the games organized by the bar for the bravest disturbing the start of the festivities. There was however no need to worry because the 50 international students there went all out on their dedicated night. The Chinese were dancing on top of the tables, the Brazilians were doing choreographies with the French following in their steps haphazardly. The view was glorious, the Wei succeeded where the Babel tower failed. This evening was so lit that an extinguisher had to intervene to cool it down.</p>
                <p>It then was the last day but where is everybody during breakfast? They all must have lost themselves on their way to their room last night but no worries, the BDS had prepared an initiation to orienteering to fix that and the results were made public at the end of the day, this time. (but what of the BDE sports event?). It finally was the last evening and the members of TSM showed what they’ve got, with lows that wreck your eardrums and people jumping and letting go: we had to enjoy it while it lasted. Some even found themselves stargazing on the dunes, others didn’t sleep and decided to take a swim at 7 am, but who took care of cleaning the rooms?</p>
                <p>Finally, after a last brunch we headed to the bus where sleep was rampant and tight. The organizers were finally able to sleep after all their good work and the first years were able to resume their search for housing, but the year was only beginning.</p>
                <p>Thanks to Léo, Mauro and all the people responsible for the Wei for this memorable experience, you did a fantastic job!</p>
