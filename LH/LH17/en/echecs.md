## Introduction
Hi ! I'm Tedrhuyagonall. Let's talk about chess!

> Boudiou (french equivalent of good god), Tedrhuyagonall, we don't know who you are by the way

Well, yeah. It's a stupid pseudonym. I chose it because I didn't have any ideas and with a name like that, at least no one could steal it from me.

> Ok. And what on earth are you going to tell us ?

We'll talk about chess. I'll present myself quickly, I started to play chess when I was 6 yo and then I stopped, then I started to play again when I was 17 and this time I didn't stop. I have to admit, I played and studied this game more than physics during my 2 years of prépa (= classe préparatoire, schools where you prepare the entrance examinations for schools like Télécom Paris).

> Wow, and what will you do?

Analyse games. Most will be mine, I disputed quite a lot of "long" games online, at 30+30 or 45+45 speeds on the site [Lichess4545](https://www.lichess4545.com), which allows you to register for single or team tournaments. So, I've got enough material for a while.

> But, how will you analyse this gloubi-boulga (= mix of strange substances) ?

I'll put everything on an unlisted Lichess study. Every week, I'll add a commented game in French, although with the English notations for the chess moves.

Well, I'll stop asking questions, this format is pretty cringe.

It's been quite a while since I started playing long games on Lichess4545. You connect to it via Lichess, you join a discussion forum and play against people from all over the world. Consequently, you need to free up a time-slot that suits both players, which is relatively complicated when you have to play against a New Zealander for instance. People are generally nice.  

I think I'll publish here IRL or online games analysis.  

Concerning the format for this little chronicle,  I'm simply going to integrate the chapter of the study on this page, giving beforehand the context of the game and a little moral at the end.

To see the study, it's **[HERE](https://lichess.org/study/1SqN72Mt/i2W5S4j8)**!

I'm always open to criticism. If you've played an outstanding game, it can also be included in this review.

## Analysis

Since the introduction is done, we can start.

In this first analysis, I offer you a game in 10+5 that I played without any particular context. It was this summer, on holiday, and I'd just finished dinner.

**On the menu** : a pretty boring game at first, but it quickly took a wrong turn and ended with a magnificent geometric sequence.

**N.B.** For maximal convenience, click on « $\vdots$ » and then on « view on Lichess ».

## Moral

1. If you're looking for something complicated without being forced into it, there are certainly simpler and more effective ways.
2. When you're on the defence and you have time, apply yourself. The game can quickly shift.
3. When your attack relies on columns and open diagonals, you have to make sure that your opponent is unable to close them before you do anything crazy.

Thanks a lot for your patience, I've still got two nice games in stock, ready to be analysed.

See you later !
