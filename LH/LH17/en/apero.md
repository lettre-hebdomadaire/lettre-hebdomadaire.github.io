*Reviews of the aperitifs of the two lists of last week*  
## Forum West's aperitif :

Starter course : The mix of vegetables is consistent and an improvement on the first aperitif, worth 5/10. 

Main course : Fries are simple and effective, the burger was really incredible. 11/10 !! \
-1 for the flagrant inequality : The LH presidents had better bread than I did, bad luck, they aren't the ones doing the review this evening!  

Dessert : Cookies again. Originality wise, not great, the last campaign in which there weren't any must date from 1877. But, hey, they're tasty. 6/10 Come on, orange blossom in the pastry is nice, and original, 7/10 \
And +1 for distributing seconds in the end, 8/10, this is my last word.  

## Forum club's aperitif : 

Starter course : Easy vegetables that must've been leftovers from Friday's aperitif, it smells of minimum efforts, but the sauce goes well with it. Just goes to show you can do things easily AND well. 7/10  

Main course : The quantity is poor compared to the competition's, the wrap is good but definitely not up to the task against Forum West. 5/10  

Dessert : The French toast is well cooked and goes down easily. 7/10. \
+1 bonus point for the spread, which is Nutella without palm oil, the Amazon forest thanks you (and MaD too).

I'm giving 3 bonus points (one per course) for the homemade iced tea which clearly makes the difference. Make some more, I'd drink litres and litres of it.

### Which gives the final grade : 
Forum West :  7.66/10
Forum Club : 7.66/10
Damn, equality again ! One day we'll be able to choose....
