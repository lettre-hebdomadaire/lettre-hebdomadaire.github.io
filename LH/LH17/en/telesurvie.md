Hello you!

Are you a Minecraft fan who wants to be able to play in peace with your friends without having to worry about anarchy problems or the limitations of microtransactions servers?

Well then, I'm proud to offer you Télécraft !

Télécraft is a java 1.20.1 survival server in the style of Holycube or Hermitcraft for those in the know.

Télécraft offers you :
- A whitelisted server accessible in basic version (known as vanilla) 1.20.1 and open to all Télécom Paris's students (and their close and trusted friends).
- A relaxed, cooperative game environment where grievances and abusive murders are strictly forbidden and will be sanctioned.
- A free experience where the only limit is your creativity - you will never be asked to pay for anything.
- Modifications on the generation side of the server and on the gameplay to make the experience more interesting and enjoyable, for which you can vote for below.
- A life cycle that lasts one year, until the beginning of the next school year, at which point the final map will be distributed and the server will update and reset for the new students.

Interested ?

You can also fill this form to give your Minecraft pseudonym for the whitelist (minimum required to play) and give your opinion on the modifications you would like to see (optional) : [Link for the form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSci3Bro1gIQkfQXF5P89OZPMlTvKqkr2hQ12PZ3jpQEHG76yQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)

The server's ip will be **137.194.13.82:25565**, launch planned on Saturday the 30th of September at 20 p.m

If you don't know how to launch the game in a specific version, in the launcher go to configuration, new configuration, and for version select release 1.20.1 (and if you want to add more RAM for the game, change -Xms2G in the java arguments to -XmsNG where N is the number of Gb of RAM you want to give to the game (>=4 if possible)). You can find the illustrated tutorial below.
