The forum campaigns are in full swing, but we couldn't care less; we're continuing with LH. We've already spammed you quite a bit, and we're not going to stop! This week: the second aperonomic critique, a superb analysis of chess games, an interview with the author of one of LH's pillars: the Babar fanfic, a highly descriptive account of a swim in the X lake, and finally, the launch article for Telecraft! Sending you kisses, and as the editor-in-chief, who was supposed to write this editorial, would say: "Oh, yeah. Uh, I'm eating right now."
