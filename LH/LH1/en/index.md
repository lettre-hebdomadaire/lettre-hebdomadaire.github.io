You thought it was dead, but it was only hibernating, molting, metamorphosing. What you are reading marks the return of the Weekly Letter. New format, new team, same mess: we are delighted to send you this first issue so that you can (re)discover Telecom's journalism. Investigations, scandals, censorship, but also fun little games, crazy contests and illustrations, join the adventure by sending us your contributions and enjoying the selection of the week. Will it come back next week? Who knows. We hope so, anyway.
