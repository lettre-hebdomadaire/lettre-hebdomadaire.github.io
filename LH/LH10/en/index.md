Between the end of the PACT, approaching exams, the Binouze de Passation X the Federez Days, and (for a good portion of the WN editors) the Harry Potter marathon at the Grand Rex this weekend, the end of the year is far from relaxing. However, it's getting hotter and hotter, people are dining outside, and despite the spread of this plague that is the concrete jungle on the plateau, the flowers are still abundant and delight our eyes with their vibrant colors.

All of this makes us feel like we're on vacation ahead of time, but be careful, friends from Télécom, the year is not over yet! Nonetheless, we hope that you'll be able to enjoy this beautiful weather between study sessions (we recommend one hour of studying for every 20 minutes of walking in the park and hugging trees for optimal exam results, tested and approved by scientists and by us).
