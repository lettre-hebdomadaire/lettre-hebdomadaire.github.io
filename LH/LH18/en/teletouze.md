title: "The CHAT's minute: Télétouze"
---
At the CHAT's minute, we offer to go back for a few instants on a point in the telecommian history. Today, well talk about the mythical ascension of **Télétouze** (~Téléorgy).
> Télétouze is a fictional club created for the forum's campaign. Congratulations to the Forum West for their contribution ! 
## *According to you, where did the Bar ~~fucked~~ kissed the BDE for the first time?*

We don't have a lot of information on the creators of this mythical club. Some rumors assert that it came to life during a meeting between the BDE and the Bar. The telecommian life was profoundly **frustrated** until this moment.

We estimated its golden age was around 2015. Back then, the association was at the beginning and the end of the Alpha brochure. ~~Télétouze takes the back and the front~~

It was eventually banned by the administration, who saw too many excesses.

### Fun-facts : 
1. In 2015, a survey revealed that one out of two télécommians participated in a télétouze(~téléorgy).
2. During parties, two teams of ten maintenance workers worked relentlessly to ensure the maximum hygiene.
3. The Christmas télétouze was the event gathering the most telecommians.
4. The largest télétouzes were recorded by Comète. They are still available in their archives. To see them, you must murmur a secret word in the ear of the president. This word is only known by some télécommians that graduated and Comète's presidents.
