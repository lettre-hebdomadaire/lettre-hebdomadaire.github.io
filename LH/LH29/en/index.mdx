Hello dear Telereaders!

Despite the challenges of the weather, lack of sleep, and despite Rezel not loving us anymore (ðŸ¥º), we are here, stronger than ever and more alive than ever!

The LH is not just surviving; it is thriving thanks to you and all the magnificent articles you send us every week. We love you \<3

So, without keeping you in suspense any longer, happy reading, and see you next week!
