title: "My experience of the WEI"
---

The WEI is over. I know it as much by my incredible rationality as by our dear weiose which fogs my head and clogs my lungs. It’s almost as if my time in prepa did not train my immune system properly for those days of debauchery, these crowd baths and the fire alarm at 5 am. Or was my body expecting to sleep to regain strength? It’s not my fault that it expected 2As to be reasonable. Personally, it’s been 3 years that I rarely communicate with my body.

If my body could summarize the WEI, it would probably talk of mistreatment of a person that’s already not in a really good shape. Make dance and run an infirm, wake up (thanks Mouloud) an insomniac. Make someone that was in prepa drink. But here torturers are trendy so let’s stop talking about my body.

In other terms, the WEI it’s a little like throwing away yourself into a a joyous fanfare where you don't know anyone, over which you have as much control as you have the right to sleep. We discover a world, we run (we try), we listen to our elders (sometimes) who strive to keep us alive (often). We learn a little about school, we forget very quickly, almost as quickly as the names of other students. We dress up, we meet as many Cleopatras as Axels, a few pyramids, and Milou the day after. We play at night as well as during the day, some at cards, others at coin-coin without a board (I do not recommend mixing the two).

The wei is a bit like the burial (perhaps temporary) of the knowledge and self-control that we so sought after in prepa. We bury it in the sand, we deafen it with music, but above all we drown it in the laughter of others. Thank you to those who made it possible, thank you to those who survived it alongside me.

Come on, I'm going back to cough up my lungs and wish you all a good start to the school year!
