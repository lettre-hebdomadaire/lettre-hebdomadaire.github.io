We promised it to you (not really).\
You've been waiting for it (not really either).\
Here's the new LH recipe, the first alcoholic recipe: the Lychee Cocktail.

## Ingredients (for 6 glasses)
- 6 lychees in syrup
- 12 cl of Soho (lychee liqueur)
- 36 cl of lemonade (or lemon-flavored water if you don't like bubbles or forgot the soda)
- 6 cl of grenadine
- ice cubes and mint leaves

## Preparation
As you might have guessed, mix all the liquids in a jar, stir, and let it sit in the fridge for a few minutes.
Serve in tall glasses with a lychee at the bottom and an ice cube, decorated with a mint leaf.

For a non-alcoholic version, replace the Soho with cranberry juice!
