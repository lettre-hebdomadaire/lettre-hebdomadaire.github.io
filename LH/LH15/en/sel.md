*So much the better, that makes us an article ;)*

As group 6, I was able to do the shotgun 24 hours before, and even then there was a D slot which was already full

the shotgun was so good, I loved it

I got up at 7:40 a.m. and I'm very happy ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„

Why do we do law? And then finance too? What's the point?

I woke up early so I got the shotgun when it opened. Frankly, waking up at 7:50 a.m. for a SG at 8 a.m. isnâ€™t very smartâ€¦\
Doing everything at the last minute, that's what it's like

Oh the haters who weren't connected in advance

Honestly, I loved how it went, it was great ;)

Well, it was necessary to be in work-study mode: opening of the campaign the day before, I did it at 1 p.m. while shitting after my coffee and cigarette and I got what I wanted\
I even made a perfect so this D slot campaign was satisfying

It was supposed to start at 8 a.m. and it started before, I wanted SES 202 and there were no more slots, even if afterwards a 3A, Tristan I think, said it wasn't that great. Actually , apart from that I had luck so I'm not complaining too much

People who are angry because they wake up at 7:50 a.m. for an 8 a.m. illness. Being 25 minutes early for something like that isn't much.\
Because of work-study students and international students, some classes were full before our SG, so even with 30 minutes in advance we had to improvise, and yet that's the game, no need to launch a revolution."
