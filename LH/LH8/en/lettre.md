Weakly Newsletter implies letter of the week. This week's lucky letter is P! The sixteenth letter of the alphabet is perfectly chosen for this first edition of the letter of the week, as it refers to the various daily problems that our dear Telecomian will have to overcome in the coming week. Whether it's PACT (Procrastination and Anxiety Chronic Troubles) or the upcoming Partial exams, we will all be affected!

PACT problems:

As the Telecomian who read us already know, PACT also refers to a project that weighs you down throughout your first year at Télécom Paris (NainA in telecom jargon). The meaning we will focus on today is quite different. PACT is also the acronym for "Procrastination and Anxiety Chronic Troubles". Faced with a project requiring organization, it is indeed very common to have to deal with Procrastination. This plague of work, coupled with the perverse entertainment systems of social networks, such as Insta and Youtube, copying the format of TikTok, pushes us to an irrational and endless consumption of content, most often mind-numbing. A vicious circle is created. Without skills no production, without production no personal gratification, without gratification no motivation, without motivation and with hours in front of a screen empty of code that's where the anxiety comes in... Anxiety that blocks the acquisition of skills, closing the loop.

Procrastination having hit me again I think I'll write the rest of the article later...

Let's meet again next week for a new letter!
