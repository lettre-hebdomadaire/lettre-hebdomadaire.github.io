 The sun is shining, birds are singing, it's springtime! Everything should be going well, and yet, something is missing. You can't quite put your finger on it, but you feel it deep inside. You try lying in the sun, eating your favorite sweets, or playing video games with your friends, but nothing seems to work. And then, a notification on your phone (because you subscribed to our newsletter, of course!). The 8th edition of the Weekly Letter is out! Your day brightens up, and your mind calms down. Ah, there it is — the missing piece to a perfect day has fallen into place, and you can peacefully enjoy your afternoon.

 Summary of the week (so you don't have to leave your bed): BDS campaigns are raging, accompanied by a series of ridiculous challenges. A subgroup of the telecom students went to the WEFA (lucky them), the IP Pride procession paraded around the campus to the sound of marching bands, and the first years had no choice but to make deals with the devil to manage to complete their PACT for PAN4.
