 Departing 1 hour and 20 minutes late, the WEFA participants spent Wednesday night in the buses that took them to Saint-Léger-les-Mélèzes, a small ski resort in the Alps.

 Arriving at 9:30 am at the residence (rustic! no plugs in the rooms, and a few showers and toilets per floor), students got a breakfast offered by the BDE, and the announcement of some changes in the planning: no via ferrata due to the weather! Speaking of the weather, it remained constantly grey throughout the weekend, but with almost no rain.
After that, the lunch was held in the dining room of the residence.
The poor unfortunate souls who had picked via ferrata went rafting (a really cool experience with offbeat instructors (hello Bernard) in a magnificent setting) while the others spent the afternoon in an accrobranche park (translater's note: tree-climbing adventure park).
 After an apéro prepared by Téléfrom, the first supper (with many "Ma bite" and sacrifices) took place, thus preceding the first party of this stay.
On Friday, the accrobranche enthusiasts had "the chance" to go rafting at 10am.
In the afternoon, those who had not been able to do via ferrata the day before were offered Hot-Dog as a replacement, a variant of rafting in which the 8-person boat is replaced by a 2-person buoy, and without an instructor, an activity full of sensations. However, a majority of withdrawals led to the creation of a counter-activity: a 10km hike with 650m of positive altitude difference starting from the residence. At the top, the hikers could enjoy a breathtaking view (see Comet pictures, really go and see) at 2000m of altitude on the surrounding mountains.

 In the evening, a Snax x Télébreizh apéro, a meal accompanied by even more "Ma bite" and a pre-party around a campfire preceded the second party.
Special mention to the members of the Bar, who sang their song approximately 5,6 * 10^3 times around the whole residence (if someone didn't know it by heart yet, don't worry, it's fixed).
On Saturday, after a hard awakening, everyone boarded the buses for an afternoon at the lake, with kayaking, paddle boarding, ball games, and hikes.
Back at the residence, a group photo was taken, followed by a Forum apéro, a surprisingly calm meal and a Just Dance before the last party of this WEFA. At midnight, everyone gathered in the aptly named "Fun Room" for a "wedding-like" video of BDE memories, an emotional moment for the Bedias.
The party raged on, although interrupted once by the fire alarm, and we note a high number of sacrifices to the pure mountain air (therapeutic properties assured!).

 On Sunday, the last day, the Télécommie ns had to tidy up their rooms early in the morning, before having breakfast, taking a last photo (dedication to Hortense's roll from the top of the slope to reach the photo location), and embarking for the return trip, thus closing this superb WEFA with an arrival in Télécom on Sunday evening.
A big thank you to both BDE for this memorable stay!
