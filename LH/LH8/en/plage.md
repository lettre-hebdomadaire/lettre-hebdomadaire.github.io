I talked with a beach once. I was almost burried, the ear close to the whispers of the sand. I listened.

You don't know how much these little grains, shy and lonely, can talk when they're all together. Only... they have a voice as small as their body, a voice of a few micrometers maybe even less so you shouldn't hesitate to come closer.

They were telling me the secrets of all of this beach. Each and every one of the little steps around, the small confessions on the towels and the foam, where the algae were resting from a day spent playing between the waves. And the children too. I tried to get up but you must undestand, I was a beach.\
I was the new grain, a little bit bigger than the others, yes, but I was grain and we were one.

Two people were loving each other on the beach and I knew it. The word had spread to the neighbors, two people were loving each other and they even had a dog. May I close my eyes a little more, I want to feel only the cold from this end of a summer day on the beach, on me, on us. These people were loving each other and their laughs had shook us.

And slowly, I felt growing in me the rythms of the swells beating on my body of beach. The measures were moving awat little by little, and I felt myself growing by seeing these waves fleeing ! May the tide go even lower, so that I can feel even stronger in my body of grains the emulsion of this beach ! May my edges extend. The thick foam of the water's edges, just like the one of glasses of Bordeaux, everything is trembling in each of my cells. And these two people, so far from us, were loveing each other and kissing, and we knew it but they didn't. They were so innoncent and so powerless, we were the place of their love and the nature that they watched. They didn't know how much we looked at them and how we blushed under the so very talkative woman that were telling us just how much these two people were loving each other that day.

Suddenly I get up. I was a man again. I seized, with a handful, some grains that were once friends. There was a misunderstanding. I was not like them and they didn't want to talk to me anymore. So I squeezed them, full of nostalgia. I looked at that beach.

On the edge, there were a huge line of algae. This is were the sea had fought the farthest. The beach had won again during this evening. Me, I felt miserable and I watched two people having fun with their dog.

I found them deeply ugly. The sun already wasn't talking anymore, then the sky had the good taste to stop talking too. In fact, nature was very quiet now. It's her that I wanted to meet tonight.

I laid down, exhausted. The grains standed me again. One came to whisper to me one last time. I smiled. He had me promise to him not to tell you any of this. But what do you want... I was a man before being a beach.
