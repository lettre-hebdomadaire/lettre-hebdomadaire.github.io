Yes, LH is back for the third consecutive time. Amazing, isn't it? But you see, this time, we're here to talk about really important things. To save the lost Telecommien, to answer their deepest questions. And that's why today, we're talking about Telecom's best-kept secret (the location of JC Dufour on a pact day), or even about the supreme happiness achievable in only one way: through the path of cheese. So, dear Telecommiens eager to know, don't wait any longer: the letter is here to meet your needs.
