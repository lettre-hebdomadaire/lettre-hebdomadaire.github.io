title: "What's the best association, and why is it the BDI?"
---

Hi peeps ! 
First of all, believe me when I say I am not Quentin Roussel, the most international French student of Telecom. Nor am I Mauro Parafati. I'm not even an international student.
I'm just a huge fan.

Why am I such a huge fan of the BDI ?

Well, firstly, I love integration, including of internationals. Secondly, I love France, I've never been out of the country and I don't intend to. My honeymoon will be in France. I'll spend my weeks abroad in French-speaking Belgium, which is already way too far for my taste. For Athens I got Paris and that was my first choice. So I really appreciate the existence of an association dedicated to discovering the culture of other countries and helping international students to enjoy the beauty of France. 


There are three activities I love in Telecom student life: the French village (France, fuck yeah), the international village (you don't even have to travel to enjoy the best of the world), and the BDI activities. 
The outings in Paris are really interesting, whether you're an international or a frenchy French guy like me. You can visit places you'd never think of going to on your own, like the Banque de France, and they also offer great classics at reduced prices, like a trip on a bateau-mouche. I can't recommend it enough. What's more, the photos are always high-quality, so you can send them to your abuela (you learn some great words talking to inter students) and she'll be happy to find you even more beautiful than usual. 

The Barbecue Des Internationaux is an absolute banger, frankly they put KFT and Telebreizh to shame, they can't compete. The pork chops are super delicious, and the salad is superbly seasoned, unlike the list ap√©ros, which is what you get for building French-exclusive lists. Join the BDI, it'll help you meet people with rich cultures who can save you from fiascos like the tabbouleh (it'll never let you go). 

In short: join the BDI.
