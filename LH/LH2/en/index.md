Hola, it's us again ! Surprising and yet, here is the second edition of the new Lettre, which seems to be weekly for real (if two occurrences are enough for you physicists to generalize). On the program this week : a great investigation, a fun little game, something about menhir throwing and a look back at the election of the new BDE. See you next week, perhaps.
