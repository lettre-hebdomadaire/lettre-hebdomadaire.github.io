Hello, it's us again! Unfortunately for you, we're not going anywhere soon, so you'll have to get used to it :). On the agenda this week: investigations, drama, misinformation, but also meditation, laughter, and good things. We offer you Le journal d'une chienne, an ode to meditation, a brief review of FUPS that took place last night, an investigation conducted on Telebreizh (by the way, the crepes were incredible!), a small selection of memes, and an exclusive Rubiks Square!
