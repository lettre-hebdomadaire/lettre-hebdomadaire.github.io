title: "THANG goes Grimm : Twitch the evil witch"
---
A long, long time ago, about 200 years ago, or maybe a bit less, nobody really knows, the gorgeous streamer Amor Ant gave birth to a little girl who then lived in luxury and received compliments for her beauty for 20 years. Unfortunately, A. Ant’s beauty progressively faded away; her JustAFan page was no longer cashing in, and the girl’s father left them for the younger Poki Woman. The now beautiful grown woman took on the role of her mother, reviving the interest of the viewers and making the money flow again. However, she never forgot the story of her mother and therefore chose to act. She lived a double life, a student of witchcraft during the day and a streamer at night in the prestigious sorcery school of Gladywartz.

She finished her curriculum with two things: a new name, Twitch, and the formula to stay forever young and beautiful. For the next century and more, she evaded taxes by moving to different countries and opened several channels of DIY, cooking, gaming, ASMR, hot tubs, and more; all while collecting the ingredients for her eternal youth: children.

To know what happens next, come to see it at our THANG representation on the 20th and 21st of December.
