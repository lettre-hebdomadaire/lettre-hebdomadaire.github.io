窶ア week had gone by since their rendez-vous. Babar looks at his phone. No notification. Did Shrek not enjoy our night together ? Did I say something wrong ? So many questions were fuming in his head. What if after all Shrek didn't like him ? He cannot think about this all right now, his son announced the day before that he would move to the USA for his studies.

窶ィabar had always been an involved father. When his son told him that he would go far away for his studies, his first reaction were to open a wine bottle to celebrate. It's only the night after that doubts began to emerge. His son was leaving, and he couldn't do anything about it, it is how it is. Babar is arriving at the age in which people are more often left thant joined in life. During this little party for his son, all of his friends were there. He was reassured to see him in such a good company.

窶グne of his son's friend came to see him. He had a very "cool" style, thought Babar. A tuft of spiked hair, all in blue.

-Aren't you going to feel lonely?\
-Ah, but what do you want, this is the contract one must sign as a parent.\
What about you, are you leaving with my son?\
-No, I'm not really going to school... (he seems embarassed)\
-Ah, of course, you are the one who's racing!\
-Yes, that's it.\
He put a thumb up.\
-I've been told about you, you're preparing for the OG, right ?\
He put a thumb up again. He follows up :\
-I did not dare to say it because I know your career, I know how much of an intellectual you are...\
-Come on ! I'd love to be able to run as fast as you ;)\
-We could run together some day... If you feel alone.\
-Oh, thank you for the proposal, but you would get past me very quickly...\
-I could wait for you or slowdown... (smugly)\
Babar talked with other friends of his son, but this one stood out. He had a smug behaviour that he still tried to hide.

窶ィabar comes home from work and hears his phone vibrating. He gets it out as fast as he heard it, and he sees with sorrow that Shrek still hasn't sent him any message. His heart aches, he just received a message from his son's friend, Sonic.

"Hi, we talked at the birthday. (i had blue hair ;) )\
Now, you have my number. So if you want to go and run today, tomorrow or any other day, you know where to ask !""

Babar doesn't understood why his heart felt this way when he read this message. It's only a proposition to do sport and yet he feels something else. He doesn't want to admit how Sonic made him feel, he is his son's friend. What would he think about all that ?
