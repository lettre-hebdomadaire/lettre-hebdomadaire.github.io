A little bit more than a week ago, the (quarter of) president of the Weakly Newsletter of Télécom announced great news to its redactors : its amazing Facebook profile had win the title of rising star. Six days later, this same profile got another badge : Best contributor.

Proud with its quality seal, the WN team hypes itself up and creates a new issue. However, proud with its intrinsically chaotic nature, the WN is changing its production rythm, and the new issue is released two days after usual.

But rest assured, dear readers. The WN is still here, it won't give you up (yet). It has not joined the dark side of the Force (it has always been there).
