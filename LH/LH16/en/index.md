So here we are again, the Forum campaign. Telecom's first campaign, dear NainAs, you don't really know what awaits you yet, but your elders do, and they intend to make the most of your efforts.

At LH, we were dead during last year's campaign. So we're not very useful. But we were thrilled to make you laugh during the Live, we can't wait to read your propaganda articles, and we wish you good luck.

Speaking of Live, let's give the final word to Ppom: "Damn, it's the LH, those weirdos."
