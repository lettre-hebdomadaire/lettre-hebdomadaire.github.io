The most basic (simple) Tabbouleh, with red onions cut large enough to give a strong taste to a really
bland recipe. Season is a French verb, I'll let you look it up in the dictionary. 3/10.

Really delicious fajitas with small grilled vegetables (great versatility of the red onion). 11/10.

Pyrotechnic effects for the show. +1.

Fruit salad is a bit easy. Raisin, banana, apple, totally exploded orange, honestly it wasn't good. But the
salad was generally okay. 4/10

Banner: it slams. Honestly classy. 10/10.

The little Lydia QR code on the menu says YES. +1

Small, more or less crunchy vegetables with a weird white kft sauce. It's fresh, a good choice. Better than
tabbouleh but the bar is low. It doesn't fly high. 4/10.

Bagel doesn't fit in my gigantic mouth even though I really am a loudmouth. I suppose there was a red
onion promotion at Franprix. Damn the bagel is dry, luckily there was lemonade. Generous chicken, tasty
trout, but not worth the fajitas. 8/10.

Not bad lemonade and it's homemade. +1.

Huge cheapskates on the red fruit crumble, it's not worth a euro. Are you on Télérat's(a rat can mean in French someone who is cheap) hidden list? It’s someone else that was responsible to serve the apple one?\
Honestly very good. When you feel the heat across the plate, you know it's going to be a good time.

10/10. -1 for stinginess. Shouldn't have let the treasurer make the portions... +1 because we took some
more.

Banner: not bad, there really is an effort at composition. But it's still less cool. 9/10.
Nice organizational effort with the little vouchers in the queue but at LH we don't like to print for so little. No bonuses.

## Score
7.75/10 for Forum Club. 7.5/10 for Forum West. Great first aperitif. I tried to make it a tie, but
your disappointing fruit salad couldn't make up for your tabbouleh which was just too bad. Our stomach
leans towards Forum Club. Bravo to the crumble.

Erratum: after writing this entire article, I had more crumble and almost choked on a apple core. -1.\
Equality.
