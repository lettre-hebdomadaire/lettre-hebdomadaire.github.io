This is a funeral eulogy in memory of the Miroir d'eau. For you, nainsA, will never know this monument of the telecommian life and the terror that accompanied it.

Once upon a time (yes, well, it was two months ago), there was no fountain in the courtyard. Instead, there was an ecosystem, or should I say, an entire universe teeming with life (mostly unknown species), right in the middle of our beautiful lawn, which, at the time, had no concrete or chains to hold the tables in place. That's another outrage for another day, but let's move on.

Back then, there was a body of water, far from pure, and a name: the Miroir d'eau. This thing, a true telecommian Styx, had a very important function: to receive the tactical vomit of telecommians â€“ vomit that, in return, constantly nourished this breeding ground. It inspired terror (no sane person would touch that water without reason, believe me), admiration (for its miraculous color changes: red in winter, green in summer), and maybe even love (???).

Until one day, something terrible happened: during the Great Concrete-ing of the Patio (a great tragedy in our history), holes were dug in the Miroir d'eau, leaving it emptied of its contents. There is no doubt that on that day, a true genocide of unidentified life occurred. Something was lost that day, comrades, I tell you. And since then, there has risen, as a perpetual reminder of what we have lost, a fountain. But no fountain will ever replace the beauty of the water mirror in our hearts.
