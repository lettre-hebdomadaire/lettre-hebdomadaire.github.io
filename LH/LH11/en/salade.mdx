**Ingredients:**

- Rice (100g per person)
- Vinegar, oil, mustard
- Salt, pepper
- And anything else you like (here: tomatoes, red onions, corn, and tuna)

**Recipe:**

Main step: Cook the rice

Contrary to the preferences of our aficionado readers (“passionate ones” in Spanish), here we will cook the rice like dogs to cool it down faster. So, fill a saucepan with salted water, bring it to a boil, add the rice, and let it cook according to the instructions on the package.

Pour the cooked rice into a strainer to drain and then rinse with cold water to cool it down.

If this technique really upsets you, you can cook the rice properly and let it cool down patiently and respectfully.

While your rice is cooking and/or cooling down:

Cut everything that needs to be cut (as desired). Here, we finely sliced the red onions and diced the tomatoes.

Mix everything with the rice. Add additional ingredients (such as capers) and olive oil, or even vinegar. The more adventurous ones can add mayonnaise (we don't kink shame).

And there you have it! Let it rest if you have the time, and serve! The 100g of rice per person makes generous portions, and everyone can eat to their satisfaction. It cost us €13 for 5 people, which comes down to a little over €2.50 per person, cheaper than the local takeout!

_Edit :  
We added mayo to the dressing, and all those who criticized the idea and made fun of me ended up apologizing because it was actually really delicious.  
So, go ahead and add plenty of mayo: it softens the dressing and gives a great taste to the rice._
