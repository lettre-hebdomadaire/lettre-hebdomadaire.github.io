窶ォave you never wondered what could a rooster even be thinking when he screams you awake every morning at 5am? Well, I haven't either, but what I do know, is that the new edition of the WN is there as always! Master of the telecomian information and entertainment, the WN is a little (too) late for WER reasons and some technical issues (tragic story :'( ), but we cooked some masterclasses for you to amend for being late!

窶ジhat happened last week? Some of the most important events of the year by golly! Let's begin with the international village! Between the empanadas, the melanzane or the gazelle ankles, we had a feast! And about the party at the end, it was incredible, very good atmosphere, we had a lot of fun Big hearts on the cooks who prepared this feast, and who sadly couldn't taste all the other meals :'(.

窶グf course, the end of the BDS campaign: Bravo Harry Sportters! And good job Sportoutatis, we had a really cool campaign thanks to you! We also had the WER, which made the hardened telecom students discover a lot of cool things for very little money (thanks BDS <3).

窶ェinally, the PACT is over, we wish for everyone who had to skip entire nights to finish their projects in time to get well soon! (We saw you in the living room of Twenty Campus at 4am). I think I got everything, enjoy!
