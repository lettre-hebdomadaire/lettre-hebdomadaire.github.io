Merry Christmas, dear Telereaders!
It's hard to believe how quickly the year has passed, and yet, already 16 publications with you this year! I would almost shed a little tear if I weren't as bitter as all the 2A+ (understand them, they're old, broken by age, and soon to be forgotten by everyone).

But anyway, Christmas is precisely here to warm our little hardened hearts and remind us of the good things! We have a family that loves us, friends who love us (one of the two is enough), and lots of wonderful people who send us articles even on Christmas Eve when they should be enjoying the festivities and all those people they haven't seen in a long time.

So, I'm going back to stuffing myself with chocolate and leftovers from the feast, making the most of it before the indigestion catches up with me.

Until next week!

(Oh, and if you don't celebrate Christmas, happy LH No. 30, it's a great day too!)
