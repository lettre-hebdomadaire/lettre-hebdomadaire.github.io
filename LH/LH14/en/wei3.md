#### Saturday 26th

It has been 5 hours since I've been on the transport, or even 23 hours, I’m not sure. The air in the TER is thin, and the seats are all shotgunned by the lucky ones, but I’m not one of them, I’m standing. After all, I’ve seen worse with RER B when I was passing my oral tests (for concours). We arrived at the camping site, and I am in building 1, which is the farthest one from the assembly point, and I imagine that this is gonna be the calmest place at night. (wink) It’s now 3.30a.m., and I’m going to bed. My disguise was in disgrace, but I still recited my monologue about 15 times. Now I have to know how to deal with my wig. A counterparty developed at the back with crossword puzzles, and it was probably the best thing I've ever observed in my life.

#### Sunday 27th
I woke up at 9.30 a.m. this morning, and the night was good, more or less good. There was plenty of coffee for breakfast but I don’t think that this is gonna do anything to me considering my level of tiredness (wink). Then was the presentation of student clubs. However I started to think that we were lied to, and also that they don’t teach English in school. Now I’m eating, and the food is amazing. 

In the afternoon, we had an Olympics, and our team was the best in all standards, but our opponents were obviously cheating. I have to create the Téléreferee club for that. And I lost my voice during Babyfoot, but it worthed it, after all, it was as much about soccer as it was about capoeira/greco-roman wrestling (I never thought to connect two such different activities into such a simple game).

The party was again huge, and they even invited JDG, I didn't think the Forum had that much budget. After a few drinks, I started to see him several times, and not in the same place, and in different voices. The ravages of alcohol, I guess. I was expecting to see JM Bruitage at the sound system and Canardman at the security, but I must have missed them. Speaking of drinks, I must say that the pints of cocktails are efficient, good (even if the taste loses its importance with time) and the staff is nice, except _______… Fortunately, glasses of water are just as effective, and toilets have become my friends. I also came across the Scooby Gang, who are surely here to solve the mystery of the unhinged doors. But I didn't have time to ask them to dwell on the mystery of my glass, which is slowly being emptied without me noticing. Another Khajiit trick.
