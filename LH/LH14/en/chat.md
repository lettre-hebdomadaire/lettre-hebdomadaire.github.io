In The minute of the CHAT, we offer you to come back shortly on a part of the telecommian history. Today, we will talk about Rezel!

Rezel has existed for almost 30 years! Created by Fran√ßois Stragier and supported by the idea of Pierre-Luc Paour: using the phone network to connect residences and students to the internet.

Rezel has also been working informally as a network provider before France Telecom! At the time, the ENST (old name of Telecom Paris) had partially financed the construction.
