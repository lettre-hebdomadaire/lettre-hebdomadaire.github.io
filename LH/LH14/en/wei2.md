"Shotgun," "NainA," "mabite," or even "coin-coin." Being an engineer is not just a formation; it's a whole language.

That's what I discovered, along with the other 206 future students at Télécom Paris during our Integration Weekend (WEI) held at 'Ville de St Denis,' a campsite by the ocean in Saint-Hilaire-de-Riez. For five days, the Bureau Des Elèves (BDE) and other associations from Télécom Paris subjected us to activities as enriching as they were varied, helping us meet our future comrades, understand how the clubs work (except for the Forum campaigns; nobody understood that part), and forge what I hope will become strong friendships.

During the WEI, various associations organized activities for all tastes, including jam sessions by La Scène, DJ baptisms by TSM (Télécom Sound&Magic), and photography lessons given by Comète members. The BDE Olympics, as well as those of the Bureau Des Sports (BDS), brought us together in groups to determine the best teams. And, of course, we mustn't forget the surprise activity: Bungee jumping! An exhilarating activity for the bravest among us, led by a team of professionals with jokes from the past and dubious looks (for more details, ask Vivien).

The WEI was also an opportunity to discover new cultures by interacting with the numerous students from China, Brazil, Colombia, Germany, and so on... All these students spoke French very well and had a thirst for learning the French language and culture. I highly recommend all French students do the same and explore different cultures with the Bureau Des Internationaux (BDI).

And how can we talk about the WEI without mentioning the parties! With music both outdoors and indoors, there was something for everyone. And the 2A students, having thought of everything, even brought board games from the Ludo to satisfy those of us who were less into partying. In short, it's enough to say that the memOraBle party with alcohol and tarot was a total success. The only thing that was really missing was the recommended 8 hours of sleep! Cut short by late-night parties until 4 in the morning and disrupted by fire alarms and Bar'itech wake-ups, our sleep was far from meeting the health ministry's recommendations.

To end on a high note (and ensure a well-pronounced "weiose"), some NainAs decided to stay up all night followed by a dip in the icy waters of the Atlantic Ocean at 7 in the morning on the last day. Being part of this group of fearless daredevils, I can tell you that some would do it every day if they could!

Finally, after a bus ride visited by Morpheus, everyone returned home to prepare for the upcoming semester, which unfortunately arrives too quickly...

The WEI is over, but the year is just beginning. Thus, these five days will be etched in our memories throughout our time at Télécom Paris and well beyond.
